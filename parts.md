# Parts

These are the parts / sources I'm using for stock / replacement GBC membranes
and buttons.

- [Silicone pads for gameboy color (1)](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gbc-replacement-silicone-pads)
- [Silicone pads for gameboy color (2)](https://www.retromodding.com/products/game-boy-color-silicone-pads)
- [Gameboy Color Button Plastics](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/cgb-custom-buttons?variant=39333911920701)

I found these parts (and others) on this excellent resource:
[List of places to get buttons and membranes
(consolemods.org)](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Game_Boy:Buttons_and_Membranes#GameBoy_Color_(CGB-001))

I Explored using Joycon buttons / membranes, but they are unfortunately too
short to match well with the height of the ESP32-S3-BOX and BOX-3:
